  <p><h2>STEP 1</h2></p>
  Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water
  and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly
  floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise
  if you like, but it's not essential for a thin crust.
  
  <p><h2>STEP 2</h2></p>
  Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room
  temperature while you get on with shaping the base.
  
  <p><h2>STEP 3</h2></p>
  Roll out the dough: if you've let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured
  surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin
  as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
  
  <p><h2>STEP 4</h2></p>
  Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on
  the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive
  oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins
  until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.
